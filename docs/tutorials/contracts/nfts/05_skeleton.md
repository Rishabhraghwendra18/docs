## Skeleton

Talk about the skeleton contract and the file structure. Show how all the functions are laid out and the code needs to be filled in. Explain that the return types have been removed so that the contract can compile. 

Go through the process of building the contract (yarn build) and how there will be a bunch of warnings that will be fixed as the tutorials go on.
